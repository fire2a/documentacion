Welcome to the Fire2a research group documentation, choose your component:

[__QGIS Fire Analytics Toolbox__](docs/qgis-toolbox/README.html): Our research as **user friendly graphical tools**: Simulate wildfires, get risk metrics, optimize firebreak location, etc. All from within [QGIS]. **Simple as filling a form**. Also available: drag'n'drop boxes (algorithms) into a *GIS-data-science-pipeline*.

[__Cell2Fire++__](docs/Cell2Fire/README.html): Forest fire simulator ([Forked]) and improved ([Here]). Supports Canada, Kitral, S&B fuel models , surface and crown fire, deals with weather scenarios, surface and vegetation moisture content; various output metrics. Also enhances in memory management, platform support, etc. **C++ only command line interface.**

[__Algorithms Library__](docs/fire2a-lib.html) of common tasks & patterns of GIS. Also showcasing proof of concepts and special algorithms developed such as landscape clustering, firebreak optimization allocation, downstream protection value, etc. **A python package.**

[__QGIS Cookbook__](docs/qgis-cookbook/README.html): Install & setup guides, python environments, plugins and workflows examples.

[__QGIS dialog DEPRECATED__](docs/qgis-dialog/README.html): Simulate forest fires, get valuable metrics, in a user friendly graphical interface through [QGIS]. __Not maintained__

# About us

We are a research group that seeks solutions to complex problems arising from the terrestrial ecosystem and its natural and anthropogenic disturbances, such as wildfires.

Currently hosted at [ISCI](https://isci.cl) offices.
